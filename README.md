## Introduction
Welcome to Aspen Capital's UI-UX Engineer challenge. This assignment will help us better assess your technical and design skills. You will be given XX days to work on this. We recommend that you focus on the requirements listed below and if time permitting - work on any additional features (of your own choosing). These additional features can be new, functional pieces within the application or even relevant design artifacts (wireframe, color palettes, etc.).

## Background
Aspen Capital is a private equity firm with offices in Portland, OR and New York, NY. We utilize data and technology to enhance business insight, propel growth, transform our investment strategies and business operations, and execute industry-leading deals. For this exercise, imagine that Aspen owns several commercial real estate properties - all of which currently operate as a chain coffee shop within the Portland metro area. The company has tasked you with designing and implementing a simple dashboard interface that will spatially display all of our commercial properties and provide access to information about each location.

## Requirements
### High Level
* Create a dashboard that plots [these (Starbucks) locations](data/coordinates.geojson) on a map - using a JavaScript mapping library of your choice.
  * Pro tip: To quickly get an idea of the data you will be working with - you can view the GeoJSON data directly in Github or if you prefer - copy/paste the raw data into an online [data viewer](https://geojsonlint.com/).
* The dashboard should display all relevant attributes that have been provided within the GeoJSON file - in both a meaningful and informative manner.
* We're looking for more than just a fullscreen map of points.
* Your application should be both intuitive and visually appealing.
* Your application should highlight your eye for design and creativity.

### Technical
* The application needs to be written primarily in JavaScript - with HTML markup and CSS stylesheets.
  * JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Vue (we currently use this at Aspen), and React are great - not mandatory.
  * CSS preprocessors would be nice - but are also not mandatory.
* Your code submission should demonstrate your ability and understanding of writing clear and concise JavaScript.
* Your submission should also higlight your proficiency in implementing clean and resuable HTML markup and CSS styling.
* Unlike some of the examples below - we do not want to see a single file HTML file with JavaScript and inline script/link tags.
